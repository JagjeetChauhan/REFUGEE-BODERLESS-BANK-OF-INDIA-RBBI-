Our blockchain project is a paradigm shift in financial inclusion for Indian refugees. By seamlessly integrating decentralized identity management with a prepaid MasterCard, we offer a secure and transparent solution. Our innovation lies in the synergy of these components, creating a comprehensive ecosystem.
